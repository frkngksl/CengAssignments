This code provides you to calculate intersection points of two shapes (only triangle and rectangle)

Usage: If you give rectangle's or triangle's coordinates in order ( it doesn't matter 1-2-3-4 or 4-3-2-1) as an array, It returns result as an array.
You need to give two input, these code works on three case: triangle-triangle, rectangle-rectangle, triangle-rectangle.
If return is [], it means that these two shapes don't intersect with each other.
